Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. It is the process of wrapping the data (variables) and the code (methods) that operate on that data within a single unit, known as a class.
Encapsulation enables data hiding and ensures that the data is protected from outside access and manipulation.
Encapsulation in Java is achieved through access modifiers such as private, public, protected, and default. 
By default, all the instance variables and methods in a class are set to default (package-private) access. 
If a variable or a method is declared as private, it can be accessed only within the class. 
If it is declared as public, it can be accessed from any part of the program. 
Protected variables and methods can be accessed within the same package and by any subclass of that class.
