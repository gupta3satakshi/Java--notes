Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. It is like an array, but there is no size limit. We can add or remove elements anytime. So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. It is found in the java.util package. The ArrayList in Java can have the duplicate elements also. It implements the List interface so we can use all the methods of the List interface here. The ArrayList maintains the insertion order internally. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List interface. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List interface.

Vector is like the dynamic array which can grow or shrink its size. Unlike array, we can store n-number of elements in it as there is no size limit. It is a part of Java Collection framework since Java 1.2. It is found in the java.util package and implements the List interface, so we can use all the methods of List interface. Vector is synchronized. Java Vector contains many legacy methods that are not the part of a collections framework.
