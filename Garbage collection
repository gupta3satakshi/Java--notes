In Java, memory management is handled automatically by the garbage collector. Garbage collection is a process of identifying and removing unused objects from memory to free up space for other objects.

Here's how the garbage collection process works in Java:

Memory is divided into two regions: the heap and the stack. Objects are created on the heap, while variables and method calls are stored on the stack.

When an object is created, Java allocates memory on the heap to store the object and creates a reference to the object on the stack.

When an object is no longer being used, it becomes eligible for garbage collection. This means that the object is no longer reachable by any references.

The garbage collector periodically checks the heap for any objects that are no longer being used. It identifies these objects by tracing references from the root set, which includes all active variables and method calls.

The garbage collector marks any eligible objects as "garbage" and adds them to a list of objects to be collected.

The garbage collector then frees up the memory occupied by the garbage objects, making it available for new objects to be created.

It's worth noting that Java's garbage collector is highly optimized and performs well in most cases. However, there are some cases where the garbage collector can become a performance bottleneck, such as when dealing with large amounts of data or when using non-standard object lifecycles. In these cases, it may be necessary to optimize your code or adjust the garbage collector settings to achieve better performance.
