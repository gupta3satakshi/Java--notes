Identifiers are the names given to the uniquely identified various programming elements like variables, arrays, methods, classes, objects, packages, interface and so on.

Identifiers in Java are symbolic names used for identification. They can be a class name, variable name, method name, package name, constant name, and more. However, In Java, There are some reserved words that cannot be used as an identifier.

While defining identifiers in Java, programmers must follow the rules listed as follows:

•An identifier must be unique in a program.
•Alphabets, digits, underscore and dollar sign characters can be used in an identifier.•An identifier must not start with a digit.
•An identifier in an upper case is different from that in the lower case.•An identifier must not contain other characters such as ‘*’, ‘;’ and white space characters (tabs, space and newline).

Some valid and invalid identifiers in Java are listed as follows:

•Pol78_ddm //valid
•hh$gl //valid
•_78hhvt4 //valid
•902gt1 //invalid as it starts with a digit
•Tyy;ui8 //invalid as it contains the ‘;’ character
•for //invalid as it is a Java keyword
•Fg026 neo //invalid as it contains spaces

In Java, literals and identifiers are used to represent values and names, respectively. Here's a brief description of each:

Literals:

A literal is a value that is written directly into the code of a program.
There are several types of literals in Java, including integer literals, floating-point literals, boolean literals, and string literals.
Integer literals can be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal, or octal notation. For example, 42 is a decimal integer literal, 0x2A is a hexadecimal integer literal, and 052 is an octal integer literal.
Floating-point literals can be expressed in either decimal or scientific notation. For example, 3.14 is a decimal floating-point literal, and 1.23e-4 is a scientific notation floating-point literal.
Boolean literals can be either true or false.
String literals are enclosed in double quotes, like this: "Hello, World!".

Identifiers:

An identifier is a name used to identify a variable, method, class, or other entity in a Java program.
An identifier must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, and can be followed by any combination of letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
Identifiers are case-sensitive, which means that foo and Foo are two different identifiers.
It is important to choose meaningful and descriptive names for identifiers to make the code more readable and maintainable.
Here's an example Java program that uses literals and identifiers:

public class MyClass {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int x = 42; // integer literal
double pi = 3.14159; // floating-point literal
boolean flag = true; // boolean literal
String message = "Hello, World!"; // string literal
System.out.println(message); // identifier for variable name
}
}

In this program, we declare four variables and initialize them with literals. We also use an identifier message to store a string literal, and then use that identifier to print the message to the console.
