Functional Programming in Java allows developers to create and use Functional Interfaces. A Functional Interface is an interface that has only one abstract method (also known as a Single Abstract Method interface or SAM interface) and can be used as the target for lambda expressions or method references. In other words, a Functional Interface is an interface that represents a single unit of behavior.

In Java, the @FunctionalInterface annotation is used to declare that an interface is a Functional Interface. This annotation is optional, but it is recommended as it helps to catch errors at compile-time. If an interface marked with this annotation has more than one abstract method, the compiler will report an error.

Functional Interfaces are used extensively in Java's Stream API, which provides a declarative way of processing collections of objects. The Stream API allows developers to write code that is concise, readable, and expressive.

Java provides several built-in functional interfaces in the java.util.function package. Some of the commonly used functional interfaces are:

Consumer<T> - represents an operation that takes in one argument of type T and returns no result.
Supplier<T> - represents a supplier of results of type T.
Function<T, R> - represents a function that takes in one argument of type T and returns a result of type R.
Predicate<T> - represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument of type T.
UnaryOperator<T> - represents an operation on a single operand of type T that produces a result of type T.
BinaryOperator<T> - represents an operation on two operands of type T that produces a result of type T.
Functional Interfaces can also be defined by developers in their own code. Defining custom Functional Interfaces allows developers to create abstractions that can be reused across their codebase, making it more modular and easier to maintain.

In summary, Functional Interfaces in Java are interfaces that have only one abstract method and can be used as the target for lambda expressions or method references. They are extensively used in Java's Stream API and can be defined by developers in their own code.
