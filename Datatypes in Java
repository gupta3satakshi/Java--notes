Datatypes are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold.
Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. 
This means that when we create a variable we reserve some space in memory. 
Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. 
Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, we can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables. 

There are two data types available in Java .

1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non Primitive/Reference Types.
