A variable declared inside the body of the method is called a local variable.
You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists. A local variable cannot be defined with a "static" keyword.
A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared static.
It is called an instance variable because its value is instance specific and is not shared among instances.
A class variable is also called as static variable.  It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.
