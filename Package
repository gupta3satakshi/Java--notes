Choose a name for the package and include a package command as the first statement in the Java source file. 

The java source file can contain the classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types that we want to include in the package. For example, the following statement creates a package named test package â€“ package test package;

The package statement should be the first line in the source file. There can be only one package statement in each source file, and it applies to all types in the file. If a package statement is not used then the class, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types will be placed in the current default package.
