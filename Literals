Literals in Java are a synthetic representation of boolean, character, numeric, or string data. They are a means of expressing particular values within a program. They are constant values that directly appear in a program and can be assigned now to a variable. We use literals to avoid defining the constant somewhere and making up a label for it. Instead, to write the value of a constant operand as a part of the instruction.

Types of Literals

•Integer Literal – decimal, octal, hexadecimal and binary. Decimal Integer: These are the set of numbers that consist of digits from 0 to 9. Octal Integer: It is a combination of number have digits from 0 to 7 with a leading 0. Hexa-Decimal: The sequence of digits preceded by 0x or 0X is considered as hexadecimal integers. It may also include a character from a to f or A to F that represents numbers from 10 to 15, respectively.

Binary Integer: Base 2, whose digits consists of the numbers 0 and 1.

•Floating Point Literals - The values that contain decimal are floating literals. In Java, float and double primitive types fall into floating-point literals. Keep in mind while dealing with floating-point literals.

•Character Literal - A character literal is expressed as a character or an escape sequence, enclosed in a single quote ('') mark. It is always a type of char. For example, 'a', '%', '\u000d', etc.

•Boolean Literal - Boolean literals are the value that is either true or false. It may also have values 0 and 1. For example, true, 0, etc.

•String Literal - String literal is a sequence of characters that is enclosed between double quotes ("") marks. It may be alphabet, numbers, special characters, blank space, etc. For example, "java", "12345", "\n", etc.

•Backslash Literal - Java supports some special backslash characters. They are used in formatted output. \n: It is used for a new line, \t: It is used for horizontal tab, \b: It is used for blank space, \v: It is used for vertical tab, \a: It is used for a small beep, \r: It is used for carriage return, \': It is used for a single quote, \": It is used for double quotes.

•Null Literals - Null literal is often used in programs as a marker to indicate that reference type object is unavailable. The value null may be assigned to any variable, except variables of primitive types.

•Class Literals - Class literal formed by taking a type name and appending .class extension. For example, Scanner.class. It refers to the object (of type Class) that represents the type itself.
