HashMap implements Map<K, V>, Cloneable and Serializable interface. It extends AbstractMap<K, V> class. It belongs to java.util package. HashMap contains value based on the key. It may have a single null key and multiple null values. HashMap does not maintain order while iterating. It contains unique elements. It works on the principle of hashing.

TreeMap class extends AbstractMap<K, V> class and implements NavigableMap<K, V >, Cloneable, and Serializable interface. TreeMap is an example of a SortedMap. It is implemented by the Red-Black tree, which means that the order of the keys is sorted. TreeMap also contains value based on the key. TreeMap is sorted by keys. It contains unique elements.

It cannot have a null key but have multiple null values. Keys are in ascending order. It stores the object in the tree structure.
