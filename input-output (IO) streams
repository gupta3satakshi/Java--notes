In Java, input/output (I/O) streams are used to transfer data between a program and an input or output device, such as a file, network connection, or keyboard.

There are two types of I/O streams in Java: byte streams and character streams. Byte streams read and write data in the form of bytes, while character streams read and write data in the form of characters.

Byte streams are represented by the InputStream and OutputStream classes.

I/O streams are essential for reading and writing data in Java, and provide a flexible way to transfer data between a program and external devices.
