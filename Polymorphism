In Java, polymorphism is a programming concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class.

It is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms or behaviors at runtime, depending on the context in which it is used.

This can be achieved through two main mechanisms:

method overloading and method overriding.

Method overloading occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name, but different parameters.

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a new implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 

This allows the subclass to inherit the properties and methods of its superclass, but also provide its own unique implementation for specific behaviors.
