The Enum in Java is a data type which contains a fixed set of constants. 
Java Enums can be thought of as classes which have a fixed set of constants (a variable that does not change). 
Enum improves type safety. 
Enum can be easily used in switch. 
Enum can be traversed. 
Enum can have fields, constructors and methods. 
Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class.
