Method Overloading allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature can differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters or a mixture of both.

 Method overloading is also known as Compile-time Polymorphism, Static Polymorphism, or Early binding in Java.

• Changing the Number of Parameters.
• Changing Data Types of the Arguments.
• Changing the Order of the Parameters of Methods

Method overloading improves the Readability and reusability of the program. Method overloading reduces the complexity of the program. Using method overloading, programmers can perform a task efficiently and effectively. Using method overloading, it is possible to access methods performing related functions with slightly different arguments and types.

Objects of a class can also be initialized in different ways using the constructors.
