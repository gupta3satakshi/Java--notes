Queue: A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a Queue, elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front. This means that the first element that is added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures.

Here are some key features of a Queue:

Supports FIFO ordering: A Queue follows the FIFO principle, which means that the first element that is added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Provides basic operations: A Queue provides basic operations such as enqueue (add an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (remove the element from the front of the queue).

Can be used in a variety of applications: Queues are used in a variety of applications such as scheduling, task management, and event processing.

Priority Queue: A Priority Queue is a data structure that stores elements in a specific order based on their priority. Elements with higher priority are placed at the front of the queue and are the first to be removed. Priority Queues can be implemented using heaps or other data structures.

Here are some key features of a Priority Queue:

Supports priority ordering: A Priority Queue orders elements based on their priority, which can be defined by the programmer or based on the natural ordering of the elements.

Provides basic operations: A Priority Queue provides basic operations such as insert (add an element to the queue), remove (remove an element from the queue), and peek (get the element with the highest priority without removing it).

Can be used in a variety of applications: Priority Queues are used in a variety of applications such as job scheduling, network routing, and event handling.
