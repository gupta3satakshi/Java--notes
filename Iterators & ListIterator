Iterators are used in Collection framework in Java to retrieve elements one by one. It can be applied to any Collection object. By using Iterator, we can perform both read and remove operations. Iterator must be used whenever we want to enumerate elements in all Collection framework implemented interfaces like Set, List, Queue, Deque and also in all implemented classes of Map interface. Iterator is the only cursor available for entire collection framework.

Iterator object can be created by calling iterator() method present in Collection interface.

ListIterator is only applicable for List collection implemented classes like arraylist, linkedlist etc. It provides bi-directional iteration. ListIterator must be used when we want to enumerate elements of List. This cursor has more functionality(methods) than iterator. ListIterator object can be created by calling listIterator() method present in List interface.
