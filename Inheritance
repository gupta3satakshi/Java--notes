In Java, inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
The class that inherits from another class is called a subclass, while the class being inherited from is called a superclass or parent class.
When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it gains access to all of the superclass's public and protected methods and fields, and can also override or extend these methods and fields.
To create a subclass in Java, you use the "extends" keyword followed by the name of the superclass.
The following code creates a subclass called "Student" that inherits from a superclass called "Person"

class Person {
    String name;
    int age;
void sayHello() {
System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
}
}
class Student extends Person {
int grade;
void sayHello() {
System.out.println("Hi, I'm " + name + " and I'm in grade " + grade);
}
}
