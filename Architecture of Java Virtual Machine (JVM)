Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an engine that provides a runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications.
It converts Java bytecode into machine language. JVM is a part of Java Run Environment (JRE). 
The compiler produces machine code for a particular system in other programming languages. 
However, the Java compiler produces code for a Virtual Machine known as Java Virtual Machine. First, Java code is compiled into bytecode. 
This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines Between the host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language. JVM is responsible for allocating memory space.
•ClassLoader- The class loader is a subsystem for loading class files. It performs three major functions - Loading, Linking, and Initialization.
•Method Area- JVM Method Area stores class structures like metadata, the constant runtime pool, and the code for methods.
•Heap- All the Objects, their related instance variables, and arrays are stored in the heap. This memory is common and shared across multiple threads.
•JVM language Stacks- Java language Stacks store local variables, and their partial results. Each thread has its own JVM stack, created simultaneously as the thread is created. A new frame is made whenever a method is invoked, and it is deleted when the method invocation process is complete.
•PC Registers- PC register store the address of the Java virtual machine instruction which is currently executing. In Java, each thread has its separate PC register.•Native Method Stacks- Native method stacks hold the instruction of native code depending on the native library. It is written in another language instead of Java.•Execution Engine- It is a type of software used to test hardware, software, or complete systems. The test execution engine never carries any information about the tested product.
•Native Method interface- The Native Method Interface is a programming framework. It allows Java code which is running in a JVM to call by libraries and native applications.
•Native Method Libraries- Native Libraries are a collection of the Native Libraries (C, C++) which are needed by the Execution Engine.
