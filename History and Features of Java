The history of Java starts with Green Team.

Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated a revolutionary task to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc.
For the green team members, it was an advanced concept at that time. But it was suited for internet programming.
Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape. Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions,  etc. There are given the major points that describe the history of java.
James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers is called Green Team.
Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes. 3) Firstly, it was called "Green talk" by James Gosling and the file extension was .gt. 4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project. Java Version History
